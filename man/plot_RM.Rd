\title{Function that make a plot and can see a comparison between the observations and predictions}
\usage{
plot_RM(
  pred,
  y,
  upper = NULL,
  lower = NULL,
  num_days = 14,
  title = NULL,
  y_name = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pred}{- a vector of the mean of predicted values.}

\item{y}{- a vector of the observations}

\item{upper}{- the upper bound of the predicted values. If it's not specified, the plot won't draw the interval.}

\item{lower}{- the lower bound of the predicted values. If it's not specified, the plot won't draw the interval.}

\item{num_days}{- integer that indicates the number of days to predict and the default value is 14.}

\item{title}{- the title of the plot. If it's not specified, the plot won't include title.}

\item{y_name}{- the name of the y axis. If it's not specified, the name for the y axis will be "Values".}
}
\value{
A plot that can see a comparison between the observations and predictions.
